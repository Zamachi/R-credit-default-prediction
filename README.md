# About the project - R-credit-default-prediction
This is a credit default prediction project I've done using R

# To run project locally
It should be enough for you to clone the project using `git clone https://github.com/Zamachi/R-credit-default-prediction .`.
Afterwards, make sure you have R studio, R interpreter and Rtools installed, then run `Credit Card.RProject` file, which will open the R studio.
When the studio IDE is opened, install `renv` package using the package manager tool available, or type `install.packages("renv")` in the terminal.
When that is install run `renv::restore()` in the terminal to install all the packages this project requires and you should be all set.
